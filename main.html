	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a term that describes the time taken by code to be executed. If time complexity increases then it is called less efficient program and if time complexity decreases then the program is more efficient.</p>
    <p>Space complexity is similar to time complexity, O(n) is a notation which represents constant complexity <b>Space Complexity.</b></p>
